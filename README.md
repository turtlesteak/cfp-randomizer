# [Curve Fever Pro Randomizer](https://turtlesteak.github.io/cfp-randomizer/)
 Originally written in [Python](https://github.com/turtlesteak/original-cfp-randomizer), I've taken the opportunity to create a JavaScript version.

 The Python script required a Python IDE, which was a hassle.  
 Using JavaScript, it is integrated within the browser, for a user friendly experience.
